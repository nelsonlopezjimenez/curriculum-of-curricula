## Reviews

### Odin Projetc
The design is old school. It explains in detail the mechanics of HTML/CSS/JS with emphasis in getting deep but the web design's responsivness is left somewhere in the middle after exhaustive explanation of the basics of HTML/CSS. It provides a lot of external resources as 'additions' to the main topics. Some are very good, some are very detailed (not good for beginners, who are still unsure about this path).

##### Introduction: Motivation and Mindset

1. A note on AI code generation: "potentially negative impact on core learning"
1. Managing your study times: be consistent, "Don't worry, just learn!"
1. Pitfalls to avoid: a. procrastination the biggest enemy!! => follow the "**Pomodoro technique**", b. not taking breaks => solution: take breaks (listen to music, write a journal, doodle, meditate, play a quick game, go for a short walk), c. digital distractions => turn off notifications, d. physical distractions => go to a quiet place, e. rabbit holes: trying to learn all there is to know about a subject => stick a defined path, no sidetrack, no jumping, no rushing, f. comparing yourself to others => compare yourself "only to your past self", g. counterproductive note-taking => "make notes as prompts for further research" and get "comfortable with reading documentation"
