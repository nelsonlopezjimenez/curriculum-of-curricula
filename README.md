## Reviews

### Odin Projetc
The design is old school. It explains in detail the mechanics of HTML/CSS/JS with emphasis in getting deep but the web design's responsivness is left somewhere in the middle after exhaustive explanation of the basics of HTML/CSS. It provides a lot of external resources as 'additions' to the main topics. Some are very good, some are very detailed (not good for beginners, who are still unsure about this path).
